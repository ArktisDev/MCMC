# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Integration using CUDA

This project is my attempt to learn CUDA in order to code a markov chain monte carlo integration routine.

Using the Metropolis-Hastings method, we can generate numbers following an arbitrary distribution.
Picking a smart distribution, we can simplify a lot of the calculations necessary to do monte carlo integration by cancelling out parts of the integrand.
